## Azure DB Lessons

This project is a collection of POC Projects related to Microsoft Azure DB.  Some of these are designed as 101 style lessons for myself and others to use for experimentation purposes.

### POC 1

This first POC creates an Azure DB and an empty Datababse using PowerShell.  The script is a modified version of the one found at
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/scripts/sql-database-create-and-configure-database-powershell

## Other POCs
Other POCs will be added over time.  I also look forward to adding testing and other features.
